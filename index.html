        <p><h4>What does this disorder mean?</h4>
            <p></p>
            It is a condition in which a pregnant woman without diabetes develops high blood sugar levels during the period of the pregnancy. Gestational diabetes mellitus according to
            Keenan-Lindsay (2020), GDM is not a permanent disorder as glucose level mostly returns to normal around six weeks after delivery (p. 109). 
            Generally, this condition results in a few symptoms (departure from normal feelings) but has many complications

            <p><h4>Complications:</h4> 
                These include:

                Stillbirth- this means death or loss of a baby before or during delivery. Even though there are many other medical reasons for this, but it is one of the complications of DGM.

                Depression- (the most common form is known as Perinatal depression)- is depression that happens during pregnancy or in the first year after having a baby.

                Increased risk of requiring a cesarean section (or C-section)- which means the use of surgery to deliver the baby). The size of the baby is the primary factor the healthcare provider uses to determine whether an option of having a vaginal delivery. Gestational diabetes can make the foetus grow more massive than usual, thus increasing the risk of requiring a cesarean section.

                <h4>Causes of GDM:</h4>
                What causes gestational diabetes? Gestational diabetes occurs when your body can't make the extra insulin needed during pregnancy. Insulin, a hormone made in your pancreas, helps your body use glucose for energy and helps control your blood glucose levels.
