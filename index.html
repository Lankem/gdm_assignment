    <p>In pregnancy, a woman’s metabolism is affected, whether or not she is suffering from diabetes melitus. This is because more (additional) production of glucose is required to be made available to the fetus.
    Hormones estrogen and progesterone, insulinase and increased prolactin have effect in the increased resistance of cells to insulin and/increased speed of insulin breakdown during pregnancy (Smith, 2020, slide 24).
    <br>
    
    <h4>What is Gestational Diabetes?</h4>
        
    <p>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a condition in which a hormone made by the placenta prevents the body from using insulin effectively. Glucose builds up in the blood instead of being absorbed by the cells. Unlike type 1 diabetes, gestational diabetes is not caused by a lack of insulin, but by other hormones produced during pregnancy that can make insulin less effective, a condition referred to as insulin resistance. Gestational diabetic symptoms disappear around six weeks following delivery.<br/>

    <h4>Some of the Risk Factors</h4>
       <p> * Maternal obesity (BMI >OR= 30kg/m^2).<br>
        * Previous unexplained stillbirth or infant having congenital abnormalities.<br>
        * Family history of DM.<br>
        * History of macrosomic infant (>9lbs).<br>
        * History of GDM in a previous pregnancy.<br>

    <h4>Diagnosis of GDM</h4>
    <p>Prenatal screening test to identify GDM is routinely performed between 24 and 28 weeks into gestation. It could be done earlier in women with higher risk factors. This screening for GDM can be diagnosed in two different ways.<br>
    * The woman drinks 50g of oral glucose solution. This is known as the 50g oral glucose challenge test. After one hour, her blood sample is analysed for glucose; if her blood glucose level is at 7.8mmol/L of greater, that would be an indication for a more comlex test known as -the 3-hr glucose tolerance test. <br>
    * A 3-hr glucose tolerance test requiring an initial fasting, then a 1-hr and 2-hrs. Any abnormal result in the 3-hr glucose test is diagnosed for GDM (Keenan-Lindsay, 2020, p. 109).
</p>

    <h4>Complications:</h4> 
    <p>These include:<br>
        <strong>* Preeclampsia</strong>- this is suspected when high blood pressure and signs of damage to another organ system, most often the liver and kidneys are observed. Usually, it begins after 20 weeks of pregnancy in women whose blood pressure had been normal.
        (Diabetes Canada, 2018).<br>
               
        <strong>* Stillbirth</strong>- this means death or loss of a baby before or during delivery. Even though there are many other medical reasons for this, but it is one of the complications of DGM (Diabetes Canada, 2018).<br> 

        <strong>* Depression</strong>- (the most common form is known as Perinatal depression)- is depression that happens during pregnancy or in the first year after having a baby. It is a medical condition that causes feelings of sadness and a loss of interest in things one likes to do. It can affect how one feels, think and act and can interfere with one's daily life. It needs treatment to get better.
        (Diabetes Canada, 2018).<br>

        <strong>* Increased risk of requiring a cesarean section (or C-section)</strong>- which means the use of surgery to deliver the baby). The size of the baby is the primary factor the healthcare provider uses to determine whether an option of having a vaginal delivery. Gestational diabetes can make the foetus grow more massive than usual, thus increasing the risk of requiring a cesarean section.

    <h4>Gestational diabetes diet</h4>
    <p>
    •	Plenty of whole fruits and vegetables.<br>
    •	Moderate amounts of lean proteins and healthy fats.<br>
    •	Moderate amounts of whole grains, such as bread, cereal, pasta, and rice, plus starchy vegetables, such as corn and peas.<br>
    •	Fewer foods that have a lot of sugar, such as soft drinks, fruit juices, and pastries.(diabetesdose.com)

    <h4>Treatment for GDM</h4><br>

        <p>
             <strong>* Diet.</strong><br>
            Swap out refined carbohydrates such as white bread, candy and soda for fibre-filled whole alternatives like whole-grain bread, fruits and vegetables. Spread your intake of carb-containing foods throughout the day to keep your blood sugar steady.
            Eat small meals throughout the day. Rather than having three large meals per day, opt to eat small meals or low carb snacks every two to four hours.<br><br>
             <strong>* Regular monitoring of blood glucose level. </strong><br>
            Keep an eye on your blood sugar levels. Typically, blood sugar levels should be measured after each meal, but your doctor may advise testing before meals and first thing in the morning as well.<br><br>
            <strong>* Exercise.</strong>
            If you were a regular exerciser before pregnancy, talk to your doctor about sticking with your routine now. Even a short 10-minute walk after every meal can make a huge impact.<br><br>
            <strong>* Fetal assessment.</strong><br>
            This will help to identify fetal growth and the placenta ability to supply oxygen and nutrients. Ultrasound examination can be used to identify microsomia and excess amniotic fluid. <br><br>
            <strong>* Insulin administration.</strong><br>
            Oral hypoglycemic drug has been used to treat GDM and yielded success in some ways. Glyburide, which does not cross the placenta is however considered efficient to metformin which crosses the placenta but has not been shown to be teratogenic to the fetals. Injection insulin is concludedto be the most preffered medication to lower blood glucose during pregnancy.<br>
