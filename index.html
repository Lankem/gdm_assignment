            <h1>The pathophysiology of diabetes.</h1>
        </div>
<h2><p>In pregnancy, a woman’s metabolism is affected, whether or not she is suffering from diabetes melitus. This is because more (additional production of glucose is required to be made available to the fetus.
The pathophysiology of diabetes is related to the levels of insulin within the body, and the body’s ability to utilize insulin. 
In type 1 diabetes, there is a total lack of insulin. </br>
In type 2 diabetes, the peripheral tissues resist the effects of insulin.
(Jahangir Moini MD, MPH, in Epidemiology of Diabetes, 2019)</br>

The pathophysiology of diabetes is complex and involves several different hormones (i.e., insulin, glucagons, and growth). The interaction of these hormones with the liver and their involvement in renal function make the pathological mechanisms of this disease difficult to pinpoint and widely varied among patients.
(Scot Irwin, in Cardiopulmonary Physical Therapy (Fourth Edition), 2004)</br>

Hypoglycemia is a condition in which your blood sugar (glucose) level is lower than normal.</br>
Hyperglycemia is the technical term for high blood glucose (blood sugar). High blood sugar happens when the body has too little insulin or when the body can't use insulin properly</br></h2>

        <h4>What is Gestational Diabetes?</h4>
        <p></p></b>
        <h2>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a condition in which a hormone made by the placenta prevents the body from using insulin effectively. Glucose builds up in the blood instead of being absorbed by the cells</h2>

        <p><h4>What does this disorder mean?</h4>
        <p></p>
        It is a condition in which a pregnant woman without diabetes develops high blood sugar levels during the period of the pregnancy. Gestational diabetes mellitus according to
        Keenan-Lindsay (2020), GDM is not a permanent disorder as glucose level mostly returns to normal around six weeks after delivery (p. 109).
        Generally, this condition results in a few symptoms (departure from normal feelings) but has many complications <h6>courtesy: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestational_diabetes</h6>

            <p><h4>Complications:</h4> 
                These include:
                Preeclampsia- this is suspected when high blood pressure and signs of damage to another organ system, most often the liver and kidneys are observed. Usually, it begins after 20 weeks of pregnancy in women whose blood pressure had been normal.

                <p></p> 
                Stillbirth- this means death or loss of a baby before or during delivery. Even though there are many other medical reasons for this, but it is one of the complications of DGM.
                <p></p><p></p>
                Depression- (the most common form is known as Perinatal depression)- is depression that happens during pregnancy or in the first year after having a baby. It is a medical condition that causes feelings of sadness and a loss of interest in things one likes to do. It can affect how one feels, think and act and can interfere with one's daily life. It needs treatment to get better.

                Increased risk of requiring a cesarean section (or C-section)- which means the use of surgery to deliver the baby). The size of the baby is the primary factor the healthcare provider uses to determine whether an option of having a vaginal delivery. Gestational diabetes can make the foetus grow more massive than usual, thus increasing the risk of requiring a cesarean section.

                <h4>Causes of GDM:</h4>
                What causes gestational diabetes? Gestational diabetes occurs when your body can't make the extra insulin needed during pregnancy. Insulin, a hormone made in your pancreas, helps your body use glucose for energy and helps control your blood glucose levels.

                <h4>Gestational diabetes diet</h4><p></p>
                •	Plenty of whole fruits and vegetables.<p></p>
                •	Moderate amounts of lean proteins and healthy fats.<p></p>
                •	Moderate amounts of whole grains, such as bread, cereal, pasta, and rice, plus starchy vegetables, such as corn and peas.<p></p>
                •	Fewer foods that have a lot of sugar, such as soft drinks, fruit juices, and pastries.<p></p><p></p>

                <h4>5 ways to stay healthy with gestational diabetes</h4><p></p>

                <p>Most physicians perform a simple blood test on pregnant women during about 24 to 28 weeks into the pregnancies in other to get a picture of how your body reacts to insulin. If a high blood sugar level is detected, further evaluation test would be recommended involving tests on where your blood sugar is tested every hour for three hours after drinking the sugary solution. Depending on the results, your doctor will determine if you have gestational diabetes.<p></p>
                However, should that be the case, below mentioned five simple routines would keep both mother and her baby healthy throughout the gestational period.
                </p><p></p>

            1. <strong>Create a healthy carb strategy.</strong>
            Swap out refined carbohydrates such as white bread, candy and soda for fibre-filled whole alternatives like whole-grain bread, fruits and vegetables. Spread your intake of carb-containing foods throughout the day to keep your blood sugar steady.<p></p><p></p>
            2. <strong>Eat small meals throughout the day.</strong>
            Rather than having three large meals per day, opt to eat small meals or low carb snacks every two to four hours.<p></p><p></p>
            3. <strong>Stay active throughout pregnancy.</strong>
            If you were a regular exerciser before pregnancy, talk to your doctor about sticking with your routine now. Even a short 10-minute walk after every meal can make a huge impact.<p></p><p></p>
            4. <strong>Keep an eye on your blood sugar levels.</strong>
            Typically, blood sugar levels should be measured after each meal, but your doctor may advise testing before meals and first thing in the morning as well.<p></p><p></p>
            5. <strong>Share your diagnosis with your primary care doctor.</strong>
            Women with gestational diabetes have a 60 percent chance of developing Type 2 diabetes later in life; so stay in constant contact with your primary care doctor. They may even recommend testing your blood sugar levels every one to three years. <h6>courtesy: https://www.abbott.com/corpnewsroom/healthy-communities/gestational-diabetes.html</h6>
